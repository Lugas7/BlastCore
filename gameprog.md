## Development process
We developed using git and utilized the kanban board with issues assigned to different team members, though in the later stages of development this was not utilized further as some members stopped meeting in group meetings and work began more independently. 
We utilized branches by creating feature branches for each feature we were tasked with developing we would then first update the feature branch from the main branch before merging the feature branch back in to main. 

We had many shortcomings in our process. One did not utilize a strict naming convention both for following godots standard for naming functions as we used sampleFunction instead of sample_function. Another instance of this is with the naming of our nodes, scenes and variable names. One instance of inconsistent naming is that the gun is sometimes referred to as cannon.

Another limitation of our teamwork is that due to misunderstanding documentation sometimes modules created by other teammates were misused by another teammate that misunderstood how it should be used.

If we had planned better as a team for how to build our videogame with both better collaboration and better planning much of our issues could have been resolved.
### practices that could have improved our workflow

One way to improve the problems of communication and planning are in person meetings where we can get to know each other better. With in person meetings it can be easier to understand each persons goals and ideas for the game so that we could allocate responsibilities better.

Another way we could have improved our workflow is to have made and designed uml diagrams for how our game should be structured. It would be useful to know each module beforehand decided as a group. By doing this we would both improve our ability to allocate work as well as standardize naming. 

Another important benefit from having designed a uml diagram is that it could help our team understand how to use each others components properly. During our process components made by one team member were used incorrectly by another. One example of this is one team member calling the health bar set property function directly instead of the tailor made function. In this case this resulted in the health bar being modified but the damage bar not being ticked down with time as expected.
